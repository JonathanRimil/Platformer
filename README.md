Platformer Game

This is a 2D platformer game made using Python and Pygame.
It shows basic game development ideas like player movement, collision detection, animation, and level scrolling.

Game Objective:
Control the player character and move through the level.
Avoid obstacles like spikes, fire, and saws while collecting items.
The goal is to survive by running, jumping, and avoiding hazards.

Key Features:

Move left, right, and double jump

Smooth animations for running, jumping, falling, and being hit

Obstacles: fire, spikes, and spinning saws

Platforms made of blocks

Background scrolls as the player moves

Traps that cause damage on contact

How It Works:

Sprites are loaded from asset folders

Player moves using keyboard (Arrow keys or A/D, Space to jump)

Pixel-perfect collision detection

Fire and saws animate automatically

Level scrolls horizontally as the player moves

How to Run:

Install Python (version 3.x)

Install Pygame by running:
pip install pygame

Make sure the assets folder is included

Run the game:
python main.py

Purpose of the Project:
This game was made to learn about game loops, animations, collisions, and scrolling levels in Python.

Future Improvements (Planned):

Add sound and music

More advanced enemies

More interactive objects

Multiple levels

Score saving system
